# Fl-Races-Results-1950-to-2024.

**1.Overview**

This project provides a detailed analysis and visualization of F1 race results spanning over 74 years (1950–2024). Using Python, the project cleans and processes raw data, performs statistical analysis, and generates interactive visualizations to uncover insights about drivers, teams, circuits, and trends in Formula 1 history.

**Key Features:**

Comprehensive Dataset: Includes race results, drivers, constructors, and circuits.
Interactive Analysis: Statistical summaries and visual exploration of data.
Data Visualizations: Uses graphs and charts for better understanding and presentation.
Historical Insights: Analysis of trends and achievements in Formula 1.



# 2.Step-by-Step Process in Code

**Step 1: Data Import and Cleaning**

• Load the raw dataset into Python using libraries like pandas.

• Handle missing values, inconsistent formatting, and irrelevant data points.

```bash
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('data/f1_races_results.csv')

# Clean data
df.dropna(inplace=True)
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
```

**Step 2: Data Analysis**

• Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends.

Analyze key metrics like:
• Top-performing drivers and teams.
• Circuit-specific performance.
• Year-on-year performance trends.


# Get the top drivers
```bash
top_drivers = df.groupby('driver')['wins'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
print(top_drivers.head(10))
```

**Step 3: Data Visualization**

• Use libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to create visualizations

• Bar charts for driver and team performances.

• Line charts for trends over time.

```bash
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Visualize top 10 drivers
sns.barplot(x=top_drivers.head(10).values, y=top_drivers.head(10).index)
plt.title('Top 10 Drivers by Wins')
plt.show()
```

**Step 4: Generating Reports**

Create interactive reports using tools like Jupyter Notebooks or export static HTML files for sharing.
